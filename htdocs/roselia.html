                    Roselia is one of the original 5 mains bands of the BanG Dream! Franchise and is also one of the 4 live bands. The band name was taken as a combination of 
                    the two flowers "Rose" and "Camellia". The group consists of in-universe members
                    Minato Yukina (Vocalist), Hikawa Sayo (Guitarist), Imai Lisa (Bassist), Udagawa Ako (Drummer), and Shirokane Rinko (Keybordist). 
                    They're regarded as professional musicians and a highly talented band.

                <section id="cont">
                    The band was formed in 2017 with the same voice actresses to date except for Endou Yurika (Lisa's former VA) and Akesaka Satomi (Rinko's former VA).
                    About a year later in 2018, Nakashima Yuki replaced Endou Yurika due to unspecified health concerns, while Shizaki Kanon replaced Akesaka Satomi 
                    due to her hearing problems and after experiencing sudden deafness twice during live performances.

                <section id="cont">
                    In-universe, the band was formed by Yukina with a single goal in mind, that is for the band to be a part of and perform in the Future World Fes. The band practices
                    frequently at CiRCLE but they also practice at other live houses. They take everything related to music seriously and rehearse to make everything perfect
                    during their performances.
