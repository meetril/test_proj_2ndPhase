                    Morfonica is one of the main bands of the BanG Dream! Franchise and is one of the 4 live bands, being the most recently formed. 
                    They are deemed as a symphonic rock (violin rock) band. The band name is a combination 
                    of the two words "Morpho", meaning "change", and "Symphonic", meaning "harmony of sound". The in-universe members of the band are as follows: 
                    Kurata Mashiro (Vocalist), Kirigaya Touko (Guitarist), Hiromachi Nanami (Bassist), Futaba Tsukushi (Drummer), and Yashio Rui (Violinist). They are 
                    all 1st year high school students from Tsukinomori Girls' Academy, which is regarded as a prestigious school with individuals who excel in 
                    every aspect.
