                        Pastel✽Palettes, or Pasupare, is one of the original 5 main bands of the BanG Dream! Franchise. They consist of members Maruyama Aya (Vocalist),
                        Hikawa Hina (Guitarist), Shirasagi Chisato (Bassist), Yamato Maya (Drummer), and Wakamiya Eve (Keytarist). 
                        <br><br>
                        The band was formed by a talent agency. They are regarded as an "idol"band. Chisato was a child actor and celebrity, Eve was a model of the same agency that formed the band, Aya was a 
                        trainee idol before her debut, and Hina passed the auditions for the band. Lacking a drummer, Chisato brought on Maya and at first she though she didn't belong as an idol
                        and didn't fit in the band, although later on she realized she enjoyed and decided to stay, just like the other members.

                        Originally, Pasupare were fake-playing their instruments during their live performances, however after an incident that happened in the story and possible 
                        termination of the band, they began to practice their instruments and started actually playing them during lives.
