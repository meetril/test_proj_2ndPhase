                        Afterglow, shortened as Afuro or Aglo, is a band composed of 5 childhood friends Mitake Ran (Vocalist and Rhythm Guitarist), Aoba Moca (Lead Guitarist),
                        Uehara Himari (Bassist), Udagawa Tomoe (Drummer), Hazawa Tsugumi (Keyboardist) who all study at Haneoka Girls' High School and are 
                        classmates with each other. 
                        <br><br>
                        Ran moved to a different class in middle school, thus separating the squad. They decided to form a band so that they would still see each other 
                        and have a way to bond with each other. They practice after school and even attend live shows and gigs. They are fairly popular for their energetic and powerful 
                        performances.
