                        Poppin' Party, or Popipa, is one of the original 5 main bands of the BanG Dream! Franchise as well as one of the 4 live bands. 
                        The band consists of in-universe members Toyama Kasumi (Vocalist & Rhythm Guitarist), Hanazono Tae (Lead Guitarist), 
                        Ushigome Rimi (Bassist), Yamabuki Saaya (Drummer), and Ichigaya Arisa (Keyboardist). They are all from Hanasakigawa Girls' 
                        High School and are all 2nd years. They usually rehearse at the basement of Arisa's house. Though their experience and 
                        raw skill is not the best, they make up for it with their strong connection and energy they have during their performances.

                    The original franchise project was called "BanG_Dream!" in 2015 with the original members being Terakawa Aimi (VA: Kasumi), Nishimoto Rimi (VA: Rimi), and Itou Ayasa (VA: Arisa).
                    The whole premise of it was for voice actresses to play instruments and perform live with the Idolmaster (or IM@S) franchise as the inspiration for the concept since Aimi was affiliated 
                    with it, and was able to sing and play the guitar.
                    The other two members, Otsuka Sae (VA: Tae) and Ohashi Ayaka (VA: Saaya) became members of the band on BanG_Dream!'s 3rd and 4th live respectively.

                    The story of the in-universe band follows Kasumi who was always searching for the "Star Beat", something sparkling and heart-pounding, which she refers to as "Kirakira Dokidoki". She
                        found her guitar, the "Random Star", from a place called Ryuuseidou, a pawnshop that Arisa's grandparents run. With this, Arisa led her to
                        the SPACE Live House where they would watch performances together. Kasumi thought that this was the "sparkling, heart-pounding" thing she was looking for. 
                        This inspiration, along with her eagerness to practice and play the guitar, led her to the idea of forming a band with Arisa, Rimi, and Saaya, and later on Tae.
